# SOHO-Network
This project involves designing and simulating a SOHO (Small Office Home Office) Network using Cisco Packet  Tracer. The network is structured to support three departments — IT, Finance, and Customer Service — by  implementing VLANs for segmentation, router-on-a-stick for inter-VLAN communication, and DHCP for automated  IP management.
